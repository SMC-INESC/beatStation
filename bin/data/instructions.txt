You can now click the PLAY button to listen the song and start tapping on the midi interface. Then click NEXT to move to the next song. You can repeat the tapping by listening to the song a second time. If you feel that the volume is too loud or too quiet, feel free to adjust it from the VOL slider. A song has terminated when the audio stops or when the POS slider reaches 100.
